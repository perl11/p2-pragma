=head1 NAME

p2 - activate p2 extensions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use p2;
  # use extended p2 features and syntax, not found in p5p perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

p2 is in planning stage still, and I don't believe p5p perl
will be able to mimic those features. But who knows. A lot of
perl6 and p5i was implemented.
