=head1 NAME

p2 - activate p2 extensions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use p2;
  # use extended p2 features and syntax, not found in p5p perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

use p2 is used to enable extensions for the
experimental p2 perl5 implementation.

It needs to fail on p5p perl currently, but it would
be fantastic if these extensions can be used with p5p
perl also someday.

See L<http://perl11.org/p2/>
