NAME
    p2 - activate p2 extensions

SYNOPSIS
      use p2;
      # use extended p2 features and syntax, not found in p5p perl

DESCRIPTION
    use p2 is used to enable extensions for the experimental p2 perl5
    implementation.

    It needs to fail on p5p perl currently, but it would be fantastic if
    these extensions can be used with p5p perl also someday.

    See <http://perl11.org/p2/>
